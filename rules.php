<h1>American Roulette</h1>
<p>American roulette is among the table games, which enjoys the greatest popularity in casinos throughout the United States. The game tends to become more popular at casinos in Asia and the United Kingdom, but is somehow avoided by players in Europe, as their focus is primarily on the European version of roulette.</p>

<p>As we already noted, the American roulette wheel has 38 divisions, where numbers from 1 to 35, 0 and 00 can be found. Numbers from 1 to 35 are alternately colored in red , Green and black, while the single zero and the double zero are marked in green. The main objective, which any player pursuits, is to predict, which numbered pocket the roulette ball is going to settle into. In order to do that, all players make bets on a particular number, after which the dealer turns the roulette wheel in one direction and spins the roulette ball in the opposite. Once the ball finds its way into the pocket with that particular number, the respective players get paid. All 38 numbers are identically arranged on the wheel, thus, the ball has an equal probability to settle in any of the divisions.</p>
